#Battleship board game in Python, PySide
---


**Technologies**: Python, pySide, Git

**Date**: January, 2014

>It is a simple, classic, turn-based strategy board game: battleship. User as well as AI places his/her ships on 
board. The aim of the game is to destroy enemy's ships, but first it is necessary to guess their location. Each 
player (or AI) has only 1 bullet per turn. At the end scores are generated.

In the future some of the following features might be implemented:

- Facebook integration
- User online ranking
- More difficulty levels
- Play over internet (e.g., jabber/IRC/TCP)

Due to used tools, the game should be platform-independent (should work on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux).

**Requirements**:

- Python3.4
- Qt
- PySide

**Run**: 
```sh 
python main.py
```
